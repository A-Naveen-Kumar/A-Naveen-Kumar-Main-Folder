Subject: Cold flu Leave Required

Dear sir,

          I am down with heavy cold and flu because of which I will not be able to come to the office for colleague's health purpose. I think it is best that I recover properly before resuming training.
I will try to attend online training through MS Teams, if you need. Please grant me leave for 2 days. If you need additional information, please let me know.

Thank you.


Yours Sincerely,
Naveen Kumar A
